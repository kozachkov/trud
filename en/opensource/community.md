## About open-source developers community

### Gratitude

Because basically it happens on voluntary lines then people who participate in
it want to realize that their efforts and contributions is estimated at one's
true worth.

You can achieve it with help of a simple mention of members who contributed
in an open-source project. For example in perl-community and more precisely
in the source code of perl this task is done by AUTHORS file with a list
of developers and other contributors of Perl language. Also such list
can be found in documentation files under "Acknownledgements" sections.

### Communication

Community cannot exists without interaction between their members. One of
ancient way to communicate in Internet with each other is email of course and
mail lists in particular. Mail lists for perl developers
is located [here](https://lists.perl.org/)

About perl-community you can read [here](https://www.perl.org/community.html).
