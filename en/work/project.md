## About projects

An successful project differs from unsuccessful one that the first one was finished.

### About releases and changes

Than more requirements to an application for a release then rarely they will
be happen. Users can think that a project has been neglected and start to find
a replacement for it.

Every significant release of an application can support backward compatibility
and also don't do it.

Such updating can be a reason for users not to do it at all. For example by
reason of dependences other applications on a current application release.

Than more users of an application then higher probability that update of the
application will be postpone because of above-said reasons.

Some changes can break not only backward compatibility but also change the core
of an application as it happened with 6-th Perl which at the end became a new
language with another name "Raku". How to open America on the way to India as it
says.

In order to avoid such transformation you should have some principles, rules or
laws which should't be broken.

### About ideas

For estimating of a project before you start to do it it makes sense to get
feedback about it. Of course you shouldn't tell more than necessary in order to
protect you from a theft of you idea.
