## Email operations

The first rule: the order in emails is easier to keep then to create.

Mails can be split to two main types:

- demanding response;
- not demending.

For emails which doesn't demand an answer you should answer on a question to
yourself: are they necessary to me? If not, then put them to a Trash easily.

### Mail list operations

If a discussed email and answers on it don't interest you then you can skip the
whole discussion thread for it.
